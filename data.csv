Corporate responsibility | EY - India,https://www.ey.com/en_in/about-us/corporate-responsibility,"                                                             As a proud participant in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the global EY organization is committed to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to aligning strategy and operations with the UNGC Ten Principles. Through the EY Ripples program, EY people are devoting their time to SDG-focused projects, bringing together the combined skills, knowledge and experience of the global EY network in pursuit of one shared vision: to positively impact one billion lives by 2030. At the same time, across the global EY organization, we continue to challenge ourselves to embed responsibility, inclusiveness and sustainability more deeply in everything we do. This includes through global commitments to upholding and promoting human rights, and to innovating toward a net zero future. Overseeing these commitments is the EY Corporate Responsibility Governance Council, which includes several members of the EY Global Executive, and brings together leaders from across EY functions, service lines and geographies. Faced with the urgent and interconnected challenges of climate change and social inequality, we believe businesses must go further, faster, to build a better working world — one that is socially just, economically inclusive and environmentally regenerative by design. Launched in 2018, with the ambition to positively impact one billion lives by 2030, the EY Ripples program embodies our quest to lead EY people and networks in accelerating progress toward the SDGs. Listen to The Better Heroes podcast Learn how you can mitigate the impact of climate catastrophe, global unemployment, food insecurity and social inequity. Together with clients and other like-minded organizations, EY people use their distinctive skills, knowledge and experience to bring positive change across three focus areas: supporting the next generation workforce, working with impact entrepreneurs and accelerating environmental sustainability. These are the areas where we believe our combined capabilities can make the biggest impact — where each ripple we start has the potential to grow and join with others to create waves of change.       EY Global Ideathon: Farm To Fork competition The EY Global Ideathon - Farm To Fork was launched to empower new innovators and explore new solutions for food security. Photo credit: Every1Mobile EY Ripples extends the value of EY knowledge and networks to people and places we might not otherwise reach. It empowers EY people to devote their time to SDG-focused projects that apply their skills in different contexts, and help them develop as more inclusive leaders with a deeper understanding of the challenges facing low-income and marginalized communities. As more and more EY people learn to appreciate the social value of the skills they use every day, so creating long-term value for society becomes more deeply embedded in our culture.     By joining forces with clients and other like-minded organizations, we can achieve together what no one organization could achieve alone.     Tackling the interconnected challenges of climate change and social inequality requires systemic change. By joining forces with clients and other like-minded organizations — including the following — across multiple countries, we can achieve together what no one organization could achieve alone. The constellation of organizations we work with includes government bodies, nonprofits, multinational corporations and impact investors, and it’s growing all the time. EY and Forbes collaborate for impact video series Hear from impact entrepreneurs, government officials and key strategic collaborators on how we all can accelerate impact at scale. The EY Ripples program and EY teams are earning worldwide recognition from clients and collaborators for the impact they’re making. Recent awards include: At EY, we believe that when organizations align their aims with society’s, they will be more valuable and viable in the long-term, and we will all be closer to addressing some of the world’s greatest challenges. It is through this lens that we make long-term commitments, including in relation to upholding human rights and innovating toward a net zero future. EY Global Human Rights Statement The EY Global Executive has signed this statement to demonstrate its commitment to uphold and promote human rights.

FICCI-EY Report Calls for 'National Cancer Care Policy' to Address Gaps in Access and Affordability - Elets eHealth,https://ehealth.eletsonline.com/2024/11/ficci-ey-report-calls-for-national-cancer-care-policy-to-address-gaps-in-access-and-affordability/," A new report titled “Road Map for Making Cancer Care Affordable and Accessible” by FICCI-EY Parthenon has highlighted the urgent need for a national policy on cancer care in India. Compiled from a series of roundtable discussions conducted over the past year in collaboration with the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, the report emphasizes the critical need for increased funding and resources to combat the country’s rising cancer burden. Currently, only 30% of districts in India have access to comprehensive cancer centers, leading to significant healthcare disparities. The report calls for a dedicated national policy that allocates funding for the six most common types of cancers in India. Official statistics showed nearly 2 million cancer cases in 2022, though the actual figures could be 1.5 to 3 times higher. Experts warn that new cases could reach 4.5 million within the next five to six years, further straining an already limited healthcare infrastructure. Dr. Harsh Mahajan, Chair of the FICCI Health Services Committee and Founder and Chairman of Mahajan Imaging Labs, stated, “This whitepaper serves as a blueprint for action, guiding policymakers, healthcare providers, and the community to transform India’s cancer care paradigm through proactive prevention and treatment strategies.” Highlighting the role of private-public partnerships, Srimayee Chakraborty, Partner at EY Parthenon India, noted, “These partnerships are essential for driving investment and innovation, making cancer care more efficient and accessible across the country.” Malti Sachdev from Siemens Healthcare highlighted the low rate of cancer screenings among Indian women, with only 15% undergoing regular screenings for breast cancer due to fear and lack of awareness. She suggested that India could adopt models from countries like Korea and Japan, where government policies provide extensive financial coverage for cancer care and emphasize outcome-based healthcare. Also Read: IIT Ropar Unveils Affordable, Off-Grid Mechanical Knee Rehab Device; Secures Patent The report’s key recommendations include the establishment of a Comprehensive National Cancer Care Program, encompassing funding for all stages of cancer treatment, from diagnostics to surgical and radiation therapies. It also proposes enhancing existing government healthcare schemes with a top-up cancer coverage that would increase benefits by three to four times the current amount, potentially boosting access to advanced treatments and improving patient outcomes.

Respite for Indian planters as EU grants time for EUDR compliance - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/indian-coffee-growers-get-a-respite-as-eu-parliament-grants-more-time-for-eudr-compliance/article68875864.ece,"  Updated - November 17, 2024 02:51 am IST - Bengaluru/Coimbatore Shade-grown coffee at a Coffee estate in Kodagu district (Coorg), Karnataka. File | Photo Credit: Murali Kumar K. India’s major plantation sectors such as rubber and coffee have heaved a sigh of relief as the EU Parliament has voted in favour of a proposal by the European Commission to delay the implementation of EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) allowing growers, exporters and traders additional time for compliance. Accordingly, large coffee operators and exporters must meet EUDR regulations by December 30, 2025, while micro and small growers and traders have time until June 30, 2026 to comply, as against the earlier EU set mandatory due diligence procedures and compliance deadline of December 2024. Being EUDR-compliant indicates a grower’s forest-based coffee produce is legal, and not sourced from any deforested land or unethically cultivated. Notably, over 70% of Indian coffees are sold in EU countries, and therefore the compliance extension has direct implications on coffee players in India, although India was one among the few countries which grew coffee under two tier thick shade of native trees, say industry players. “Our coffee estates, in addition to coffee and shade trees has diverse flora and fauna. So Indian coffees are most sustainably grown. In spite of that India opposed EUDR since the compliance does not incentivise sustainably grown coffees,” Coffee Board of India CEO and secretary K.G. Jagadeesha told The Hindu. “Now given that EUDR is a regulation already passed by EU, we have no option but to comply as 70% of Indian coffee exported is going to EU. Coffee Board is developing a platform for assisting coffee producers in India to comply with EUDR. We also welcome the EU decision to extend the deadline,” he added. However, the Coffee Board CEO said EUDR compliance burden on planters and growers would be huge as it required technological and financial resources which won’t be compensated. Expressing similar concerns K.G. Rajeev, chairman, Karnataka Planters’ Association which represent over 70% of coffee growers in the country, said, ‘‘There are challenges in mobilisation of resources to invest by small and medium sized holdings to be EUDR compliant. Also there are elements of ambiguity. Strict enforcement without clarity on methodology to be implemented may not have desired results. All these may have adverse impact on productivity and profitability of the industry.” According to Mr. Rajeev, EUDR is a regulation with requirements for due diligence and traceability, which needs lot of data to demonstrate compliance both on ground and documentation. He insisted that Indian coffee couldn’t be compared with coffees in any other geographies as it was predominantly grown under shade. Coffee activities also encouraged preservation of existing forests which in turn provided habitat for variety of wildlife, avian populations and thus promoted natural biodiversity, he argued. Instead of putting the onus of compliance only on growers, industry institutions and government bodies should help in establishing compliance of regulations, he opined, adding, eco-friendly practices with improved soil health and carbon sequestration aligns with EUDR focus of protection of biodiversity and ecosystem. Postponement of the implementation of the EU Deforestation Regulation is expected to buoy up the international market for rubber and related products in the short term, said Santosh Kumar, chairman of the Rubber Committee of the United Planters’ Association of Southern India. “There were ambiguities and concerns in the market. Now that the EUDR will be implemented from 2026, the international market will have a positive impact in the short term,” he said. According to Rubber Board Executive Director M. Vasanthagesan, with the postponement of the regulation by an year, there is more time to prepare the rubber sector. The measures will continue, he added. The board has entered into an agreement with Hyderabad-based TRST01 as its technology partner to issue due diligence certificates to rubber exporters. “We recently held a stakeholders meeting and will start registering the exporters. We plan to do it in phases, starting with select districts in Kerala. The small-scale exporters will pay an user-fee and register,” he said. Industry sources said that of the annual production of about 8.5 lakh tonnes of natural rubber, only 4,000 tonnes are exported directly. However, exporters of rubber products will have to source from the growers who are compliant with the EUDR and so the impact will be on the growers.

Swiss Researchers Regain Access to EU Grants - SWI swissinfo.ch,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science/swiss-researchers-regain-access-to-eu-funding-amid-renewed-negotiations/88123188,"   Swiss researchers can once again apply for funding from the European Union (EU). The European Commission has announced that, starting Wednesday, researchers in Switzerland will have access to the European Research Council’s “ERC Proof of Concept Grants”. +Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox This decision comes amid ongoing negotiations between Switzerland and the EU to update bilateral agreements. “The chance to apply for new calls for proposals under the EU’s Horizon Europe research programme presents a unique opportunity to unlock the commercial or social potential of innovative work,” the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) wrote in a post on X. This content was published on
Mar 18, 2024 Bern and Brussels want to negotiate their future relationship. Can this be a good thing? This decision is a “clear sign of goodwill” from the European Commission in the ongoing negotiations. It exceeds their previous commitments, the ERC noted. In July, three calls for proposals had already been opened to Swiss researchers. This was also described as an act of “goodwill” by the Commission. However, agreements on potential grants can only be signed if the association agreement between Switzerland and the EU is in effect at that time. The debate over Switzerland’s participation in the EU research programme has a long history. Following the collapse of negotiations on a framework agreement in spring 2021, Brussels initially classified Switzerland as a non-associated third country. Since May, researchers in Switzerland have been able to apply for certain ERC grants under Horizon Europe once again. With the resumption of negotiations between the Swiss government and the European Commission in March 2024, Switzerland will be treated as an associated third country for grants once more.

Open Call for Proposals to Improve Women’s Health - EU Grants and Funding,https://eufundingportal.eu/open-call-for-proposals-to-improve-womens-health/," EU Grants and Funding Call for proposals by Pivotal for organizations around the world that are improving women’s mental and physical health to receive funding for their projects. Eligible organizations serve women and have a record of improving women’s mental or physical health. They should center equity in their approach and be poised to scale their work to strengthen the health of more women. Organizations from around the world are invited to apply.  The ability of women to exercise their full power in society is directly connected to the quality of their health. Yet today, women experience inequities across all aspects of their health.  These inequities can negatively impact their daily lives, as well as their economic prospects and prosperity, their ability to engage in their communities, and their opportunities to achieve their goals. Action for Women’s Health will support an array of organizations—of diverse geographies, sizes, perspectives, and approaches—united by their work to improve the mental and physical health of women. This initiative seeks to open access to funding streams to organizations and groups that historically have not had access to them. Action for Women’s Health will select awardees from among top-rated organizations, giving each awardee flexible funding between $1 million and $5 million.  Interested organizations are invited to visit womenshealth.leverforchange.org for more information and to take the Organizational Readiness Tool assessment to determine their eligibility.
